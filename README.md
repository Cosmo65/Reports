So far, this is an experiment to create PDF reports from structured data and
databases. It should be based on established technology. The data interface
could use an ORM (object relational model) and the output backend an PDF
generator.

The test case is a Rowing Regatta because the data model is quite complex
and allows to evaluate many bits and pieces.
